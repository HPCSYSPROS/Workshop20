**Abstract:**
The Cyprus Institute HPC Facility (HPCF) turns 10 years old this October. The Facility was established with the mandate to provide a computational resource open to all research scientists in the Eastern Mediterranean. This short paper is a brief overview of the main takeaways from starting this facility from scratch and then evolving it from a single HPC system to a diverse multi-system environment over itâ€™s 10-year history. It briefly touches on rationale behind technical, policy and other decisions and the main lessons learned by the facility staff.
