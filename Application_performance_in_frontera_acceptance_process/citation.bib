abstract = {In 2017 the NSF called for proposals for a High Performance Computing System that would replace its largest system at the time, Blue Waters, located at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. The solicitation required proposals to include a performance analysis of eleven designated scientific application benchmarks, chosen to be representative of the workload the proposed system was to support. The performance analysis was expected to project time-to-solution improvements for each benchmark on the proposed system over Blue Waters. The projected performance improvements were then required to be used as a metric for system acceptance. In this paper, we present a candid accounting of the development of the application acceptance criteria used in the Texas Advanced Computing Centerâ€™s proposal to this solicitation. We also describe the acceptance testing process on the resulting Frontera system and compare its scientific workload capacity to Blue Waters..}
