To enable parallel MSM using Charm MSA (multiphase shared arrays):

0.  Build the MSA module into your Charm library

1.  In Makefile, uncomment "CHARM_MODULES" that has "-module msa" and 
    uncomment "MSA"

2.  In src/main.ci, uncomment line "extern module ComputeMsmMgr;"

3.  Recommended approach:  "make clean ; make depends ; make"
    to make sure that all of the dependencies are correct.

    Old approach:  "(cd src ; touch `cat MsmTouch.txt`) ; make"
    to rebuild just the affected files.
