NAMD is a parallel, object-oriented molecular dynamics code designed
for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems.
NAMD is distributed free of charge and includes source code.

All distributions of NAMD include the following files:

 announce.txt
	This file contains the announcement for this version of NAMD.

 notes.txt
	This file includes directions for compiling and running NAMD
	and advice for resolving problems and reporting bugs.

 license.txt
	This file contains the license under which NAMD is distributed
	and to which you must agree in order to use the program.

Full documentation for using NAMD is available from the NAMD web site:
	http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/

VMD, NAMD, and BioCoRE represent a broad effort by the Theoretical and
Computational Biophysics Group, an NIH Center for Macromolecular
Modeling and Bioinformatics, to develop and freely distribute effective
tools (with source code) for molecular dynamics studies in structural
biology.  For more information, see http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/

The NAMD project is funded by the National Institutes of Health
National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIH 9P41GM104601).
