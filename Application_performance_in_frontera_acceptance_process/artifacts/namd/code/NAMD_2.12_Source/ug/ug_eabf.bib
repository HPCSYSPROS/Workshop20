	for accurate free--energy calculations},
  journal = {J. Chem. Theory Comput.},
  year = {2016},
  abstract = {Proper use of the adaptive biasing force (ABF) algorithm in free-energy
	calculations needs certain prerequisites to be met, namely, that
	the Jacobian for the metric transformation and its first derivative
	be available and the coarse variables be independent and fully decoupled
	from any holonomic constraint or geometric restraint, thereby limiting
	singularly the field of application of the approach. The extended
	ABF (eABF) algorithm circumvents these intrinsic limitations by applying
	the time-dependent bias onto a fictitious particle coupled to the
	coarse variable of interest by means of a stiff spring. However,
	with the current implementation of eABF in the popular molecular
	dynamics engine NAMD, a trajectory-based post-treatment is necessary
	to derive the underlying free-energy change. Usually, such a posthoc
	analysis leads to a decrease in the reliability of the free-energy
	estimates due to the inevitable loss of information, as well as to
	a drop in efficiency, which stems from substantial read-write accesses
	to file systems. We have developed a user-friendly, on-the-fly code
	for performing eABF simulations within NAMD. In the present contribution,
	this code is probed in eight illustrative examples. The performance
	of the algorithm is compared with traditional ABF, on the one hand,
	and the original eABF implementation combined with a posthoc analysis,
	on the other hand. Our results indicate that the on-the-fly eABF
	algorithm (i) supplies the correct free-energy landscape in those
	critical cases where the coarse variables at play are coupled to
	either each other or to geometric restraints or holonomic constraints,
	(ii) greatly improves the reliability of the free-energy change,
	compared to the outcome of a posthoc analysis, and (iii) represents
	a negligible additional computational effort compared to regular
	ABF. Moreover, in the proposed implementation, guidelines for choosing
	two parameters of the eABF algorithm, namely the stiffness of the
	spring and the mass of the fictitious particles, are proposed. The
	present on-the-fly eABF implementation can be viewed as the second
	generation of the ABF algorithm, expected to be widely utilized in
	the theoretical investigation of recognition and association phenomena
	relevant to physics, chemistry, and biology.},
