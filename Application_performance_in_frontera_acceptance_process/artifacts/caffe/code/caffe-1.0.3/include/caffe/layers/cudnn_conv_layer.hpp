/*
 * @brief cuDNN implementation of ConvolutionLayer.
 *        Fallback to ConvolutionLayer for CPU mode.
 *
 * cuDNN accelerates convolution through forward kernels for filtering and bias
 * plus backward kernels for the gradient w.r.t. the filters, biases, and
 * inputs. Caffe + cuDNN further speeds up the computation through forward
 * parallelism across groups and backward parallelism across gradients.
 *
 * The CUDNN engine does not have memory overhead for matrix buffers. For many
 * input and filter regimes the CUDNN engine is faster than the CAFFE engine,
 * but for fully-convolutional models and large inputs the CAFFE engine can be
 * faster as long as it fits in memory.
