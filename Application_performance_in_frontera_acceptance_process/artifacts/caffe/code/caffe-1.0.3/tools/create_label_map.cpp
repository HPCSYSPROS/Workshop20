// This program reads in pairs label names and optionally ids and display names
// and store them in LabelMap proto buffer.
// Usage:
//   create_label_map [FLAGS] MAPFILE OUTFILE
// where MAPFILE is a list of label names and optionally label ids and
// displaynames, and OUTFILE stores the information in LabelMap proto.
// Example:
//   ./build/tools/create_label_map --delimiter=" " --include_background=true
//   data/VOC2007/map.txt data/VOC2007/labelmap_voc.prototxt
// The format of MAPFILE is like following:
//   class1 [1] [someclass1]
//   ...
// The format of OUTFILE is like following:
//   item {
//     name: "class1"
//     label: 1
//     display_name: "someclass1"
//   }
//   ...
