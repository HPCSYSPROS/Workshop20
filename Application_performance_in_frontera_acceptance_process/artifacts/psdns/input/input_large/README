This directory contains the inputs for the large case for PSDNS.   

The only difference between these runs are the task counts, 32x512, 32x1024, and
32x2048.  The difference input file is just the name of the input directory
where the code was run.  The original case from Blue Waters used 32x8192 tasks.
That would not fit on the Skylake nodes.  All that has been changed is the total
task count.
