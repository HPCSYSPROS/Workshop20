PSDNS Code
==========

***VERY IMPORTANT*** Before compiling the code, make sure that BW is the target
machine for compilation in the makefile. To do this you can comment out all
"MACHINE" lines except "MACHINE = BW". Also, comment out the line
"CPPFLAGS += -DMHD" in the input file.

To compile the code, 

   module load fftw
   module load cray-hdf5-parallel
   module load craype-hugepages2M
   make srcmake
   make


Notes on the Input File and Case Setup
--------------------------------------

   - When changing the problem size, make sure nxpad, nypad, and nzpad in the
     input file match nx, ny, and nz.
   - If testing with I/O for checkpointing, make sure to run the prep_dirs
     script to make the proper number of directories for processed-based
     checkpointing (we can include instructions later for writing
     communicator-based checkpoint files). For 2**N MPI tasks, the argument to
     prep_dirs should be 2**(N/2), where N/2 uses integer division. For example,
     for 2**5=32 MPItasks, you should use "./prep_dirs 4" to make the output
     directories.
