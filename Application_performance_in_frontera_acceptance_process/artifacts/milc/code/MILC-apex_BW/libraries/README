	This directory contains code with ANSI prototyping for low
level routines for QCD simulations, and include files used by many
programs

There are two library files:
-complex.a contains routines for operations on complex numbers.  See
 complex.h for a summary.
-su3.a contains routines for operations on SU3 matrices, 3 element
 complex vectors, and Wilson vectors (12 element complex vectors).
 See su3.h for a summary.

Assembler code for some routines and some CPUs is provided.  In each
case a ".c" file of the same name contains a C routine which should
work identically.  

   .m4     Intel/Paragon
   .rs6k   IBM/RS6000
   .t3d    Cray T3D
   .t3e    SGI/Cray T3E
   .alpha  DEC/alpha

The scalar workstation code is written in ANSI standard C.  If your
compiler is not ANSI compliant, try using the gnu C compiler gcc
instead.  Note that if the library code is compiled with gcc the
application directory code must also be compiled with gcc, and vice
versa.  This is because gcc understands prototypes and the sun4 c
compiler doesn't, and they therefore pass float arguments differently.
We recommend gcc.

All library routines are single processor (no communications here) so
choose the appropriate make file according to the target processor.

Here are the steps for making the libraries:

1. Choose a make file as follows:

	SGI/Cray T3E	Make_t3e
	IBM RS6000	Make_RS6K
	Intel/i860	Make_paragon
	Cray T3D	Make_t3d
	DEC alpha	Make_alpha
	any processor	Make_vanilla (no assembly language coding)

2. Edit the Make file to get the CFLAGS and CC right.

3. Build complex.a and su3.a using, for example

      make -f Make_foo all >& make.log &
