Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Carleton,

 Here is a list of the actions we have and the modes that they can run
in.

mode:          EO               |           FN
--------------------------------+-------------------
          onelink               |  onelink   
          naik                  |  naik     
          onefatnaik            |  onefatnaik     
          p4                    |         
          fat5                  |  fat5      
          fat5tad               |  fat5tad       
          fat7                  |  fat7       
          fat7tad               |  fat7tad     
                                |  asqtad
                                |  asq

The asq and asqtad can not run in EO mode due to the optimizations we
have done. The p4 can not run in FN mode.  Also I have modified
p4_action.h so that it does not compile if FN is on.

Kostas.
