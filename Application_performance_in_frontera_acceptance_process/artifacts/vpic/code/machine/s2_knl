/* SSE accelerated compiles with gcc before gcc-3.3.x are expected not
   to work.
 
   SSE accelerated compiles with gcc-3.3.x and gcc-3.4.x are expected to
   work with a patched compiler.  Contact KJB for more information.
 
   Versions of gcc-4.0.x should be avoided in general.
 
   Versions of gcc-4.1.x are thought be to good out-of-the-box with
   SSE acceleratin BUT have issues with aliasing analysis.  Aliasing
   optimization have been disabled for the time being.
 
   To set the compilers/linkers used by mpicc/mpiCC, set the environment
   variables MPICH_CC, MPICH_CLINKER, MPICH_CCC and MPICH_CCLINKER accordingly.
 
   Due to MPI idiocy out of our control -Wno-long-long is set in
   the brutality to avoid MPI headers breaking the compile. */
