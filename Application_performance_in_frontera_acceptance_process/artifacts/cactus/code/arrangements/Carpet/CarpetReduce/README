1. Purpose

This thorn provides parallel reduction operators for Carpet.



This thorn now uses a weight function.  This makes it possible to
perform physically meaningful spatial reduction operations.  The
weight is 1 for all "normal" grid points.

The weight is set to 0 on symmetry and possible the outer boundary,
and it might be set to 1/2 on the edge of the boundary.  Setting this
depends on the coordinate thorn, and currently works only when the
coordinates are defined via CoordBase.

The weight is also reduced or set to 0 on coarser grids that are
overlaid by finer grid.

The weight should also be reduced or set to 0 near and in excised
regions.  This should happen in conjunction with an excision boundary
thorn.

This weigth function should probably be extracted into its own thorn
MaskBase, so that many thorns can easily operate on it.
