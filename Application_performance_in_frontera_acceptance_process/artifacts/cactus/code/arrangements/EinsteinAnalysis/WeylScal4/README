1. Purpose

Calculate the Weyl Scalars for a given metric given the fiducial tetrad of
Baker, Campanelli, and Lousto. PRD 65,044001 (2002) without the final null
rotations.


2. Implementation

The code is generated automatically with Mathematica.  The Mathematica
scripts are in the subdirectory "m", and the Makefile in there
re-generates the code.  This requires Mathematica and Kranc to be installed.

The scripts look for a Kranc installation in the "m" directory, in the Cactus
root directory and in $HOME as well as in the location where they find the
kranc shell-script if it is in the $PATH. If your Kranc (or kranc) directory is
in neither of these places, then you can set the environment variable KRANCPATH
to the location of your Kranc installation.

This thorn was generated using Kranc from http://github.com/ianhinder/Kranc
