<http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/index.html>.



From the web site:

PAPI provides the tool designer and application engineer with a
consistent interface and methodology for use of the performance
counter hardware found in most major microprocessors. PAPI enables
software engineers to see, in near real time, the relation between
software performance and processor events.

In addition Component PAPI provides access to a collection of
components that expose performance measurement opportunites across the
hardware and software stack.
