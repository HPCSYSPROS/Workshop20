Open MPI: Open Source High Performance Computing

A High Performance Message Passing Library

The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and
industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the
expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High
Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI library
available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors,
application developers and computer science researchers.
