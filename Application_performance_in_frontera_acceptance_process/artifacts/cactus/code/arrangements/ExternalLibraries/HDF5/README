From the HDF5 web site:

HDF5 is a data model, library, and file format for storing and
managing data. It supports an unlimited variety of datatypes, and is
designed for flexible and efficient I/O and for high volume and
complex data. HDF5 is portable and is extensible, allowing
applications to evolve in their use of HDF5. The HDF5 Technology suite
includes tools and applications for managing, manipulating, viewing,
and analyzing data in the HDF5 format.
