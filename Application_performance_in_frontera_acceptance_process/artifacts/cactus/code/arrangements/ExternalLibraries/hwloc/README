From the hwloc web site:

The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the
hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading.
It also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory
information. It primarily aims at helping applications with gathering
information about modern computing hardware so as to exploit it
accordingly and efficiently.
