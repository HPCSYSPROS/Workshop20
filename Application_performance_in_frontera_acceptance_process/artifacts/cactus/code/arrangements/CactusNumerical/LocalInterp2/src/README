This directory contains the interpolation functions registered for
   CCTK_InterpLocal()
under the names
   "first-order uniform cartesian"
   "second-order uniform cartesian"
   "third-order uniform cartesian"
and for
   CCTK_InterpLocalUniform()
under the name
   "uniform cartesian"


Implementation Notes
====================
The interpolation operators registered for different orders are mapped
via wrappers (in "Startup.c") onto a single routine (in "Operator.c"),
just passing the order as an additional argument.

The actual core interpolation routine is located in "Interpolate.cc".
