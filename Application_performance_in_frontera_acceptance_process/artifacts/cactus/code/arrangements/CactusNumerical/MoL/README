1. Purpose

This thorn provides generic time integrators.
This allows clean coupling when multiple thorns wish to integrate at the
same time.
It also means a physics thorn doesn't have to rewrite its own time
integrator.
This version is designed to work with Mesh Refinement codes as well as
unigrid.
