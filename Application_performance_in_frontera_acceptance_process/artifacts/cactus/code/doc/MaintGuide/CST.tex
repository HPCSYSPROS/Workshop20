\chapter{Introduction}

The CST is really the glue which holds the code together.  It takes the 
specifications which users have provided in their {\em .ccl} files
and generates C header and source files which are used to tell the 
flesh about the thorns.

The processing is done in three stages.  In the first stage the {\em .ccl}
files from each thorn in the {\em ThornList} are parsed and the data from them
is stored internally in databases.  In the second stage the data is 
cross-indexed for consistency.  Finally the files are written out into the 
{\em bindings} directory in the configuration directory.
