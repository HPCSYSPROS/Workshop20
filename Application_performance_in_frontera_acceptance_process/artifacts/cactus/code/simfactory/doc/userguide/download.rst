Downloading SimFactory
======================

SimFactory can be obtained by checking it out from its SVN repository:

  cd Cactus
  svn checkout ...PYSIM_2011 simfactory

The resulting simfactory directory should be located in your Cactus
source tree.  If you use the Einstein Toolkit and obtain it using
GetComponents, simfactory should be checked out automatically in the
correct location.
