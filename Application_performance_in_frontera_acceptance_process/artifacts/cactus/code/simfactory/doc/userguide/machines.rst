Machine Definitions
-------------------

A *machine definition* is a file named machine.ini in ini-file format.
There is a collection of such files in simfactory/mdb/machines.  Each
file describes the properties of a given machine, such as the host
name, the number of nodes, etc, as well as various shell commands
which are used on that machine to perform certain functions, such as
submitting jobs, and the names of the default optionlist, submission
and run scripts.
