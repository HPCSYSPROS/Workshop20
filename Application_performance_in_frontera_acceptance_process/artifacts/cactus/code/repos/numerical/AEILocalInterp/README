Purpose of the thorn
====================

This thorn does processor-local interpolation of N-dimensional data
arrays, using the CCTK_InterpLocalUniform() API.  The data arrays
(in general there may be many of them) must be defined on a uniformly
spaced grid.

This thorn provides the interpolation operators
   "Lagrange polynomial interpolation (tensor product)"
   "Lagrange polynomial interpolation (maximum degree)"
   "Hermite polynomial interpolation",
The interpolation operator
   "Lagrange polynomial interpolation"
is also accepted as a synonyms
   "Lagrange polynomial interpolation (tensor product)"
(So is "generalized polynomial interpolation", but that's deprecated
and will probably be removed at some point.)


Documentation
=============

There are 3 main sources of user documentation for this thorn:
- The Cactus Users' Guide, chapter "Application Thorn Writing",
  section "Cactus Application Interfaces", subsection "Interpolation
  Operators" (at present this is section B8.3), describes the general
  Cactus system for interpolation operators.
- The Cactus Users' Guide, chapter "Function Reference", section
  "Cactus Functions", has an entry giving a detailed description of
  the CCTK_InterpLocalUniform() interpolation API which this thorn
  supports.  This is probably the place to start reading; it also
  has a simple example.
- This thorn's Thorn Guide gives a detailed description of the
  interpolation operators this thorn supports, and their mandatory
  and optional parameter-table entries.  The Thorn Guide also
  includes both simple and more complicated examples.


History
=======

This interpolator was written by Jonathan Thornburg in winter 2001-2002.
Between then and July 2003 it lived in CactusBase/LocalInterp (in the
 src/GeneralizedPolynomial-Uniform/  subdirectory), but in July 2003 it
was moved to this (new) thorn so it could stay GPL (Cactus policies forbid
GPL code in the CactusBase arrangement).  See  CactusBase/LocalInterp/
for the older CVS history.

Other Interpolation Thorns
==========================

As well as this thorn, there are some other Cactus thorns that also
provide interpolation APIs:

CactusBase/LocalInterp
	This contains an older processor-local interpolator, supporting
	the interpolation operator
	   "uniform cartesian"

There are also driver-specific thorns providing global (grid array)
interpolation, eg. PUGHInterp, CarpetInterp, etc.
