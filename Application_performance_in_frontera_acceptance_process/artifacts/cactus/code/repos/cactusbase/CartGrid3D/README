1. Purpose

This thorn sets up a Cartesian grid, for a given domain. It also
provides a method for registering symmetries of Grid Functions
across the grid axes, and a call for applying symmetry boundary
conditions.

CartGrid3d also registers a coordinate system spher3d, under the old
API, but this is deprecated.  Spherical coordinate systems will be
provided by another thorn in the future.


2. Additional information

This thorn currently only works in 3D, in that it creates 3D grid functions.
It registers Cartesian coordinate systems of 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.
