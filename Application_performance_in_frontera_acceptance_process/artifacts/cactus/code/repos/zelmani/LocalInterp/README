1. Purpose

This thorn does processor-local interpolation of N-dimensional data
arrays.  In general there may be many input arrays (all defined on the
same uniform Cartesian grid) all being interpolated to the same set
of interpolation points.


History
=======

This interpolator was written by Thomas Radke in early 2001 (drawing
on older code by Paul Walker), and supports the interpolation operator
  "uniform cartesian"
for the new Cactus interpolation API CCTK_InterpLocalUniform().
(Note that the word "cartesian" is in lower case here!)

This interpolator originally lived in the PUGHInterp thorn, but
it turned to have very little to do with PUGH, so was moved here in
winter 2001-2002.

From winter 2001-2002 to July 2003 this thorn also contained another
interpolator written by Jonathan Thornburg, but in July 2003 that
interpolator was moved to AEIThorns/AEILocalInterp because it was
(is) GPL and Cactus policies are that this arrangement (CactusBase)
is reserved for code under the Cactus-flesh license (= GPL except
that it's like LGPL for linking with other thorns).

Because CVS can't delete directories, this thorn still contains a lot
of empty-except-for-CVS-directories directory trees left over from
Jonathan Thornburg's interpolator.  You can/should ignore these.
