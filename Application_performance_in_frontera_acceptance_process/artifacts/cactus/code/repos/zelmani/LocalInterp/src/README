This directory contains the interpolation functions registered for
   CCTK_InterpLocal()
under the names
   "first-order uniform cartesian"
   "second-order uniform cartesian"
   "third-order uniform cartesian"
and for
   CCTK_InterpLocalUniform()
under the name
   "uniform cartesian"


Implementation Notes
====================
The interpolation operators registered for different orders are mapped
via wrappers (in "Startup.c") onto a single routine (in "Operator.c"),
just passing the order as an additional argument.

The actual core interpolation routine is located in "Interpolate.c".

The subdirectories
  ./GeneralizedPolynomial-Uniform/
  ./UniformCartesian/
are empty (except for CVS subdirectories) and are left over from a
previous directory layout.  You can/should ignore them.
