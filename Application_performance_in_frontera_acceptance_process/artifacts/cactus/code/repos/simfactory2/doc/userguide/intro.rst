Introduction
============

The Simulation Factory provides an abstraction over the process of
running simulations using the Cactus Computational Toolkit.  It
handles building Cactus on a variety of supercomputers as well as
submitting Cactus jobs to their queuing systems.  It contains a
machine database with configuration information for many of the High
Performance Computing (HPC) resources commonly used with Cactus.

It is assumed that you already have a Cactus source directory which
you want to use with SimFactory.  If you don't, then you might want to
follow the `Cactus download instructions <http://cactuscode.org/download>`_.
