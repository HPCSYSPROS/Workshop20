abstract = {Leadership supercomputers, such as those operated by the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility (ALCF), provide an important avenue for scientific exploration and discovery, enabling simulation, data analysis & visualization, and artificial intelligence at massive scale. As we move into the exascale supercomputing era in 2021 with the advent of Aurora, Frontier, and other exascale machines, itâ€™s important that we are able to understand the interactions between the applications being run, and the hardware they run on, to optimize the use of these expensive and high-demand resources.}
